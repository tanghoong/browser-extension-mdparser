- In page scrollbars need some styling to match the overall design. default is overflow hidden, when mouse hovered it shows scrollbar but it looks clunky.

- normal code block please use dark theme and the text side is smaller.
- Please always show the copy button on code blocks, not just on hover.
- The "Copied!" feedback should be more visually distinct, perhaps changing the button color briefly.
- TTS please adjust the female voice to be less robotic and more natural.
- not using emoji for the interface icon, use SVG icons instead for better scalability and appearance.

- enhance well the sidebar for metadata display, make it collapsible and stylish.
- enhance well the "table of Cotents" sidebar, make it collapsible and stylish.
- Adjust the TTS controls container as header sticky on center top, dont cover content.
- the dark mode background color should be a bit lighter, pure black is too harsh on eyes.
- re adjust the layout design to make it more modern and clean.
